The no internet dinosaur game made in Pygame.

## How to play
Install pygame by doing `pip install pygame`, clone the repo and run the `main.py`. Space is jump :)
## Things I think are cool
### Transition
There's a subtle fade in at at the start of the game and a fade out when respawn that acts as a cool scene transition.

### Button
There's a button in the top right that respawns the player when dead but pressing space does the same thing as it felt natural to me for that to also make the game restart. This was tested and subjects would tend to press space on their own without ever going to the button to respawn.
